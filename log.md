# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## Project Goal: I don't have one yet, but as I start to learn more about python, I will add one

### Day 0: May 20, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I started off my python learning making use of the Python Bible course on Udemy, and so far I have learned about variables and numbers. I also worked on a project provided by the course that had me write code for making a health potion for a game character.

**Thoughts**: It was really interesting to see how the code worked, and the project helped me understand the concepts i've learned so far.

### Day 1: May 21, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about strings, making code to receive user input, and formatting the data to arrange the input the way you like. I worked on a project that had me ask a user questions for input that has them introduce themselves as an output.

**Thoughts**: I had a little difficulty understanding how formatting worked, but the project helped to clarify that as well as looking at some other examples of how to use format.

### Day 2: May 23, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about methods, and slicing, and worked on a project to create an email slicer.

**Thoughts**: It was a really good project, and it did a good job of helping understand how to slice, and it brought in components from my previous lessons which helped  me remember what I had learned.

### Day 3: May 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about logical and conditional flow. I got to uderstand how Bolean works, and made use of comparison operators and logical operators, and got to see what they did and how they worked together.

**Thoughts**: It looks like there will be a lot to do with logical and comparison operators, and I can imagine how complicated the code can get with it, but I am excited to see what sorts of projects can be made from them.

### Day 4: May 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about data structures in python. I learned how to create lists, tuples, and dictionaries. I worked on two projects, one focused on using dictionaires, and the other tying together all that I have learned since I started the python bible course.

**Thoughts**: I will need to work on more projects to internalize how to make use of and manipulate data structures as well as everything else I have learned so far. Thankfully the python bible course on udem has me understanding everything I have learned so far, and I have not had any issue trying to understand any concepts.

### Day 5: May 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about loops, while loops and for loops specifically. I worked on 2 projects. One that had me simulate a baby conversation with thte baby asking me why? over and over. The other project was code that turned regular english into pig latin.

**Thoughts**: There was a lot to learn working on these two projects and I will have to revisit these modules in the course again to fully absorb everything. I think this is where the difficulty starts. I don't yet fuilly grasp how I can take all I have learned so far to create an idea I have. I understand how the code works and functions during the tutorial, but being able to take the language and mold it into ideas as I wish is still beyond me, but this is just day 6. I have barely started.

### Day 6: May 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about functions, keyword parameters, and default parameters. I learned about packing and unpacking variables.

**Thoughts**: This was a difficult section to grasp. I will be revisiting to better understand.

### Day 7: May 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on a project to create a tic tac toe game.

**Thoughts**: I enjoyed making the game, and it was cool to see all the things I have learned so far be used in the game.

### Day 8: May 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It was broken down to classes and objects, and making use of contstructers, destructers, polymorphism, and methods.

**Thoughts**: It was not easy to grasp the concept of OOP as well as how to make use of the parent class, children class, and methods contained in them. I will need to revisit and practice to get it down.

### Day 9: May 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Was a slow day. I continued to learn about OOP and making use of data structures in OOP. 

**Thoughts**: It was still a struggle to grasp so I will practice some more.

### Day 10: May 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on a bank project making use of OOP. I finished my Udemy course on python as well.
**Thoughts**: I had a better understanding of how OOP works, and how the code works, but still need more practice.
