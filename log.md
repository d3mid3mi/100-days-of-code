# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## Project Goal: I don't have one yet, but as I start to learn more about python, I will add one

### Day 0: May 20, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I started off my python learning making use of the Python Bible course on Udemy, and so far I have learned about variables and numbers. I also worked on a project provided by the course that had me write code for making a health potion for a game character.

**Thoughts**: It was really interesting to see how the code worked, and the project helped me understand the concepts i've learned so far.

### Day 1: May 21, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about strings, making code to receive user input, and formatting the data to arrange the input the way you like. I worked on a project that had me ask a user questions for input that has them introduce themselves as an output.

**Thoughts**: I had a little difficulty understanding how formatting worked, but the project helped to clarify that as well as looking at some other examples of how to use format.
